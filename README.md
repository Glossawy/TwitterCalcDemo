# Twitter Calculator Demo Code
---

This is the code I used for the Reference during my live presentation. The code is fairly commented
now and the Library I wrote to hide Twitter and hack details is also included and viewable.

The Library Code (tclib) was NOT done during the presentation, but it's source code is available if
you are interested.

### Notes on Use:
---

- _**To use the code you will need to include the library in your source, or download the release.**_
- _**The release includes the library as a jar file and the twitter logo.**_
- _**The Twitter logo must be in the root of the working directory!**_


### Plagiarism
---

- _**Please do not plagiarize, you only risk putting yourself in a bad position and potentially myself**_
- _**Leading form point one, do not simple copy and paste, contact me for help if you really need it**_
- _**This is meant to be a learning opportunity and tool! DO NOT ABUSE IT!**_
